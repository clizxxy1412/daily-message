Whatever you're doing, it's not enough. Do what you can, and the point is to minimize the regret you have later in life.
You may be comparing yourself with others around you, but here's a fact: you will never have to search far for someone who is far better than you. The only important comparison in my opinion is with your yesterday's self.
Is a hotdog a sandwich? Of course not, they wouldn't be called hotdogs otherwise.
You may not realize it today but you've done one thing in your day that was positive even if you think there isn't. It's important to congratulate yourself on your smallest accomplishments and keep going.
HI THERE BUDDY
The easiest thing to do when you look at others achieving things is think "They're in a higher level than me, I can't do that". Always consider that most of these people started out exactly like you, and as long as you try your luck will be in your favor eventually.
